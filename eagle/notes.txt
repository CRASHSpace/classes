eagle is nice because it is
 - free to learn
 - cross platform
 - easily to fab from
 - has libraries available
 - the beginner tool of choice... sorta
 - maker tool of choice.. sorta
 - scripting / ULP !


SCHEMATIC::

01 ADD parts:
new project, new schematic
ADD is hard. the search is terrible. libraries need to be in "use"

import from your fab
try lots of different ones

05 graphics

save often


FAB::

01 have someone else look at it

02 double check your BOM

03 check your geometry

04 oshpark is easy
