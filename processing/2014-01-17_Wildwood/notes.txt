Processing Syllabus

Processing is a wonderful language for first-time programmers. It is also great for recreational programming, which is a wonderful kind of programming for learning — I find it is much better to play at it than to work at it.

But, the name is unfortunate.

ide:
- download from processing.org
- run (Ctrl-r)
- save (Ctrl-t)
- find help (shift-Ctrl-f)

code:
- share on openprocessing.org
- comments // and /* with */
- white space is awesome
- type safety makes compilers awesome
- verbs/functions/methods are denoted with '(' and ')'
- commands end with ';'

drawing shapes:
- ellipse, rect, triangle
- point, line,
- order matters
- 3d stuff exists... much later

colors:
- size, background,
- stroke, strokeWeight,
- fill,
- colorModes and HSB
- alpha is cool

syntax:
- now we are really programming
- functions, variables,
- draw, setup

animation:
- now we're having fun
- standard variables: mouseX, mouseY, frameCount
- lots of math operators: +, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, &, |
control flow: if, else, while, for,

images:
- this is crazy town and you are in it
- loadImage, imageMode, image,

libraries:
- sound : minim… wow.
- LeapMotion exists. find the library on the internet!
