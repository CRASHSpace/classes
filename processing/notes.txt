Processing


Processing is a wonderful language for first-time programmers. It is also great for recreational programming, which is a wonderful kind of programming for learning â€” I find it is much better to play at it than to work at it.

But, the name is unfortunate.

ide: 
 - download from processing.org
 - run
 - save



code:  
 - share on openprocessing.orf
 - comments
 - white space is awesome
 - type safety makes compilers awesome
 - verbs/functions are denoted with '(' and ')'
 - commands end with ';'

drawing shapes: 
 - ellipse, rect, triangle
 - point, line,
 - order matters 
 - 3d stuff exists... much later

colors: 
 - background, 
 - stroke,  strokeWeight, 
 - fill,
 - colorModes
 - alpha is cool

syntax:  
 - now we are really programming
 - functions, variables, 
 - draw, setup

animation:
 - now we're having fun
 - standard variables: mouseX, mouseY, frameCount
 - lots of math operators: +, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, &, |

control flow: if, else, while, for, 

images: 
 - this is crazy town and you are in it
 - loadImage, imageMode, image, 

libraries: 
 - sound
 - serial
 - midi
 - the internet!
