Download and Install Arduino from http://arduino.cc


Arduino : an intro

a community :
 - LOTs of help, 
 - tutorials, examples, projects,
 - forums, libraries, kits 

microcontroller :
 - a very small (micro) computer
 - i/o, ram, storage, bias, network!
 - you can add your own peripherals

open standard :
 - anyone can improve it
 - it works with everything

 - this makes it cheap

development environment : 
 - your software interface
 - add, compile, run, and debug code
 - built for students to be easy

programming language :
 - the syntax and semantics are pretty useful

 - java/c... sorta
 - blink


bootloader :
 - an OS
 - that loads code
 - it is The Magic

learn electronics:
 - circuits are easy
 - low power and no soldering
 - reusable parts make for free play

input / output:
 - many pins for input and output
 - capable of analog and digital
 - serial communication
 
programs are simple: 
 - variables
 - setup and loop
 - libraries

Analog and Digital:
 - All Arduino signals are either Analog or Digital
 - All computers including Arduino, only understand Digital
 - It is important to understand the difference between Analog and Digital signals since Analog signals require an Analog to Digital conversion



Output

Output is always Digital

To Output a Digital signal (On or Off) use this code:

digitalWrite ( pinNumber , value );

Where value is HIGH or LOW

To output a signal that pretends to be Analog use this code:

analogWrite ( pinNumber, value );
Where value is a number 0 - 255


Output is always Digital

Using a Digital signal that pretends to be an Analog signal is called Pulse Width Modulation

Use Pulse Width Modulation, or P.W.M., for anything that requires a signal between HIGH and LOW

P.W.M. is available on Arduino pins # 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11
