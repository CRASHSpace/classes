<h1 class="title" align="center">The Ultimate Beginners Guide to Soldering 
Cool Neon Wire</h1>

<h2 class="title" align="center">Jeremy Paul Bagai</h2>

<br>
<br>


<p>
You have an amazing idea for a Cool Neon project, but all your friends 
are too busy with their own projects to do your soldering.  (If only 
they had been willing to teach you the last time—there were days and 
days before Burning Man started!)  No matter.  You’ve come to the right 
place.</p>  

<p>
There are other Cool Neon soldering guides on the Web; 
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Solder-EL-Electroluminescent-Wire/" target="_blank">good</a> 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPDpl72RAhQ" target="_blank">ones</a>,
 even.  But each assumes you have some basic understanding of soldering,
 and then applies that knowledge to Cool Neon.  Not this one.  We 
understand you majored in English, or philosophy.  (Or worse, 
psychology.)  This guide takes you, the Ultimate Beginner, step by 
photo-illustrated step through the process of soldering a Cool Neon 
joint.</p>

<img src="SolderGuide_files/1Final.jpg" align="right" height="519" width="600">

<br clear="all">
<br>

<p>Here is the final product: a strand of lit Cool Neon wire.  From the 
top: A power source (battery) plugs into a driver (1).  The driver comes
 connected to a driver-side connecter (2).  The driver-side connecter 
accepts a plug-in connection from the wire-side connecter (3).  This 
connection can be pulled apart and pushed together at will.  The 
wire-side connecter must be soldered to a strand of Cool Neon wire (4). 
 That’s what this guide will teach you to do.</p><p>

<p>You may already have all these items individually.  But probably not,
 given that you are the Ultimate Beginner.  Buy them together, cheap, 
from Cool Neon.  This guide uses tools and material only from the Cool 
Neon: Learn to Solder Kit.</p>

<br>


<h2><a name="1.3">1.3 How long it will take</a></h2>
<p>Someone experienced in the ways of soldering Cool Neon, having all 
the necessary tools in easy reach, can solder a joint in under two 
minutes.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, someone with no experience 
soldering (much less soldering Cool Neon), in possession of an unopened 
Learn to Solder Kit and only this page for guidance, might reasonably 
expect to spend two hours getting that first wire to glow.  The second 
one will be much faster.</p>

results.  Caveat lector.  Palma non sine pulvere.  Per angusta ad 
augusta.)</i></p>

<h1><a name="2">2. About soldering</a></h1>
<h2><a name="2.1">2.1 What is soldering?</a></h2>  
<p>Like welding, soldering is a means of joining together two or more 
pieces of metal.  It requires less heat than welding because it does not
 involve melting the metal pieces together.  Instead, solder, a filler 
material with a low melting point, melts and flows over the joint.</p>



<h3>2.1.1 What is a soldering iron?</h3>
<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/3Iron.jpg" align="right" height="171" width="300">Like a clothes iron, a soldering iron is simply a metal surface that gets hot when plugged in.</p>

<br clear="all">

<h3><a name="2.1.2">2.1.2 What does it mean to pre-tin?</a></h3>
<p>Instead of applying solder to two pieces of untreated metal (slow and
 difficult), first coat each piece of metal with solder.  Then solder 
together the pre-tined pieces (quick and easy).</p> 
<h3><a name="2.1.3">2.1.3 The Basic Principle: Heat wire, not solder</a></h3>
<p>Metal heats slowly; solder heats quickly.  Applying hot solder to 
cold metal will not form a strong bond.  Instead, put cold solder in 
contact with cold metal, and use the soldering iron to heat the metal 
from the opposite side.  When the metal gets hot enough, it will melt 
the solder and form a strong bond.</p>  

<p>This applies mostly to the process of pre-tinning.  Use the iron to 
heat the metal you want to tin, then apply solder to the hot metal.  
Joining metals that are already pre-tinned is quick and easy, because 
the surrounding solder melts quickly and easily.</p>


<br>
<h2><a name="2.2">2.2 Why solder?</a></h2>
<p>I’m in a hurry. Can’t I just tape my wire to my connecter?</p>  
<p>Yes, you can.  The join might hold for up to an hour.  Unless it is put under any stress.</p> 

<br><br>

<h1><a name="3">3. The Basic Joint</a></h1>
<h2><a name="3.1">3.1 Overview</a></h2>
<h3>3.1.1 Cool Neon wire anatomy</h3>

<img src="SolderGuide_files/4Anatomy.jpg" align="right" height="413" width="600">

<br clear="all">
<br>

<p>Your Cool Neon wire consists of a vinyl cover (1), under which lives 
an inner coating (2), under which live two corona wires (3), and a core 
wire (4).  (Hella Phat Cool Neon wire has two layers of inner coating.  
Angel Hair Cool Neon wire has no vinyl cover.  These variations have 
little effect on soldering, other than how the wire is to be prepared.)</p>

<h3><a name="3.1.2">3.1.2 What will get connected</a></h3>

<img src="SolderGuide_files/5Connected.jpg" align="right" height="378" width="600">

<br clear="all">
<br>

<p>The basic Cool Neon joint consists of two soldered connections.  
First, the core wire must be soldered to the short end of the connecter 
pigtail (1).  Then, the two corona wires must be soldered to the long 
end of the connecter pigtail (2).  The two pigtail ends of the connecter
 are staggered to prevent the connections from touching and shorting 
out.  In particular, notice that the black cover of the long pigtail 
will not come in contact with the core wire, but instead will only touch
 red vinyl cover.</p>  

<br>
<h2><a name="3.2">3.2 Prepare end of wire</a></h2><a name="3.2">    
</a><h3><a name="3.2.1">3.2.1 Strip outer coating</a></h3>
<p>Grab a strand of Cool Neon wire.  You can attach a connecter to 
either end.  Your first step will be to strip ¾ of an inch of vinyl 
coating off one end of the wire.</p>  

<p>You will find the wire stripper provided to be adequate but not 
ideal.  If you have a better one, by all means use it.  Better ones run 
$20 to $30.  (Inexpensive if you strip a lot of wire; too expensive for a
 $30 beginners kit.)  The provided stripper has two holes: the smaller 
is for cutting and the larger is for stripping.</p>        


<img class="grid" src="SolderGuide_files/6Strip1.jpg" align="left" height="193" width="300"> 
<img class="grid" src="SolderGuide_files/7Strip2.jpg" align="right" height="193" width="300">
<br clear="all">

<p>Thread ¾ of an inch of wire through the larger hole.  Grip lightly 
and rotate 90 degrees in each direction.  (Grip too hard and you may cut
 through the wire entirely.)  Release pressure and slide the stripper 
off wire.  Pull off the vinyl coating.</p>     

<p>
<img class="grid" src="SolderGuide_files/8Strip3.jpg" align="left" height="193" width="300"> 
<img class="grid" src="SolderGuide_files/9Strip4.jpg" align="right" height="193" width="300">
<br clear="all">
</p>


<h3>3.2.2 Strip inner coating, revealing core and two corona wires</h3>

<p>Your wire has ¾ of an inch of vinyl coating removed, exposing an 
inner coating.  You need to remove that inner coating without damaging 
the two corona wires wrapped around the core wire.  There are three 
methods for completing this step:</p>

<h4>3.2.2.1 Method 1:  Use a good wire stripper</h4>

<p>If you have a much better wire stripper than the one in the kit, you 
may be able to set it to remove the inner coating without causing any 
damage.  In fact, with such a wire stripper, you may be able to combine 
steps <a href="#3.2.1">3.2.1</a> and 3.2.2, and reveal the corona wires in one motion.  More power to you.  If you do not have such a tool . . .</p>


<h4>3.2.2.2 Method 2:  Use side of soldering iron</h4>

<p>
<img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/10IronMelt.jpg" align="right" height="193" width="300">
The inner coating will melt away under heat.  Plug in your soldering 
iron.  Touch the inner coating to the side of the iron, rotating the 
wire such that heat is applied evenly.  Using Kleenex to protect your 
fingers, pull the melting inner coating off the wire to reveal the core 
wire and two corona wires.</p> 
<br clear="all">    

<h4>3.2.2.3 Method 3:  Use a lighter</h4>

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/11FlameMelt.jpg" align="right" height="193" width="300">
Alternatively, use a lighter to burn away the inner coating, rotating 
the wire such that heat is applied evenly.  Either pull off the residue 
(using Kleenex to protect your fingers), or continue to apply heat until
 the entire inner coating has melted away, revealing the core wire and 
two corona wires.  Note that both Methods 2 and 3 release toxic-smelling
 fumes which are unlikely to be beneficial to your health.</p>  
<br clear="all">    

<h3>3.2.3 Test corona wires</h3>

<p>
<img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/12WireTug.jpg" align="right" height="193" width="300">
Tug on the two corona wires to make sure they are still strong and have not been damaged by the stripping process.</p>  

<p>I know.  You’re hesitant to do this.  It took you three tries to get 
the wire stripped, and four tries after that to burn off the inner 
coating without burning the corona wires.  They look fragile.  If you 
tug them and they break, you’ll have to start all over.</p>

<p>Tug on them anyway.  If they break, better you find out now rather 
than after doing all the soldering.  Then you’ll end up with wire that 
doesn’t light and you won’t know why.  Tug on them, and if they’re good,
 bend them back out of the way.</p><br>
       

<h3>3.2.4 Scrape phosphor off main wire</h3>

<p>
<img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/13Scrape.jpg" align="right" height="193" width="300">
You’ve bent the corona wires safely out of the way?  Good.  Now use a 
razor blade to strip off the dull-white phosphor cover of the central 
wire, exposing the shiny metal surface.</p>   
<br clear="all">   


<h3><a name="3.2.5">3.2.5 Thread heat-shrink tubing for later use</a></h3>

<br>
<img src="SolderGuide_files/14Thread.jpg" align="right" height="199" width="600">

<br clear="all">

<br>

<p>Cut off a 1.5 inch strip of heat-shrink tubing and thread it over the
 two pigtails of the wire-side connecter  Congratulate yourself on 
remembering to do this.  Notice that the tubing will not fit over the 
white plastic end of the connecter.  Which means that any shmoe who 
forgets to thread the tubing over the wire before soldering has a 
problem.  Now you’re ready to begin soldering.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="3.3">3.3 How many hands do I need?</a></h2>

<p>Consider what it is you’re about to do: apply solder and a soldering 
iron to two pieces of metal which must be held in place together.  Those
 of you sufficiently limber and with fine foot-eye dexterity will have 
no problem holding all four components.  The rest of us need to consider
 how to proceed.  There are two methods:</p>

<h3>3.3.1 Method 1:  A hands-free device</h3>

<p>
<img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/15Hand.jpg" align="right" height="225" hspace="20" width="150">
You can find these on the Web for under $10 by googling “helping hand 
soldering.”  The clips hold the wire and connecter together and in 
place, freeing two hands to hold the solder and iron.  This is a fine 
solution for those that are so inclined.  Or you can make one with a 
block of wood, glue, and clothespins.</p>  

<p>The downsides are that it costs money or time or energy (who has 
clothespins lying around anymore?), and then you become dependent upon 
it.  Suppose a friend asks you to solder a joint at his house?  “Sure, 
but first I have to buy some clothespins.”  Perhaps you should just 
learn the next method.</p>

<h3>3.3.2 Method 2:  A simpler device</h3>

<p>
<img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/16Cup.jpg" align="right" height="276" width="300">
Place the soldering iron in the fixation device known as a coffee cup.  
The iron-tip should extend up, out of the cup, and the power cord should
 be kept safe on the other side, unless you like the smell of burning 
plastic.</p>
<p>No, it's not at all stable.  But it shouldn't matter since you won't be putting any pressure on it.</p>

<h3>3.4.1 Seasoning the soldering iron</h3>

<p>
<img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/17Seasoning.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="200">
A new soldering iron can take a long time to heat some other metal hot 
enough to melt solder.  It will all happen, but it will take long enough
 to make you wonder if you’re doing something wrong.  There is a 
short-cut, based on the familiar notion that solder heats quickly.  Turn
 on your soldering iron and wait until it is hot to the touch.  Apply 
some solder to the tip of the iron.  The solder on the iron will quickly
 get hot.  Use that hot spot to heat whatever metal you want to heat.  
You might think of this technique as pre-tinning the soldering iron.</p>

<p>Note that this does not violate the Basic Principle <a href="#2.1.3">(2.1.3)</a>.
  You are not heating the solder to apply it to cold metal, which would 
form a weak bond.  Instead, you are using a spot of hot solder to heat 
metal, which in turn will melt new solder.</p>

<br clear="all">

<h3><a name="3.4.2">3.4.2 Pre-tin core wire</a></h3>

<p>
<img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/18PreTinCore.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="200">
As noted in <a href="#2.1.2">2.1.2</a>, to pre-tin is to coat metal with
 solder in order to make the subsequent joint stronger.  The corona 
wires are thin and do not require pre-tinning.  The connecter wires from
 Cool Neon are all pre-tinned.  All that is left to pre-tin is the newly
 exposed core-wire.</p> 

<p>With the soldering iron held by the (coffee cup) fixation device, 
hold the exposed core wire in one hand and touch it to the tip of the 
iron (on the hot spot created in the step above).  Hold a short length 
of solder in the other hand and touch it to the core wire (not to the 
soldering iron).</p> 

<p><i>What happens next is great.</i> When the core wire heats up enough
 to melt the solder, the solder will melt around and cover the core 
wire, looking exactly like the liquid-metal effects in Terminator 2 and 
The Abyss.  Your core-wire is now pre-tinned.</p>

<br clear="all">

<h3><a name="3.4.3">3.4.3 Solder core wire</a></h3>

<p>You’re now ready to join some metal.  Go back and make sure that the 
heat-shrink tubing has been threaded over the connecter wire!  Ready?  
Ok.  Apply a tiny bit of solder to the tip of the iron.  (A tiny bit.  
There may already be some there, left over from previous soldering.  
That’s probably enough.)  Put the solder down.  Hold the wire in one 
hand and the connecter in the other, such that the core wire lies 
alongside the short pigtail.  There is no need to twist them together.  
Lock your pinkies together so that your hands move together as a single 
unit.  This should help keep the pieces from moving apart.</p>

<br>
<img src="SolderGuide_files/19SolderCore.jpg" align="right" height="454" width="600">

<br clear="all">

<br>

<p>Bring the joint to the tip of the soldering iron.  Fairly quickly, 
the available solder will flow over the pre-tinned core wire and the 
factory pre-tinned connecter wires.  Once the solder flows, remove the 
joint from the heat of the iron so that it can cool.  You must keep it 
very steady at this point so that the solder forms a strong bond.  (This
 is the reason you have locked you pinkies together.)</p>  

<p>Within seconds the joint cools and becomes as strong as the wire itself.</p>
  
<h3>3.4.4 Trim sharp edges</h3>

<p>Occasionally the solder will form spikes or sharp edges protruding 
away from the joint, which may become problematic when the heat-shrink 
tubing is applied.  You don’t want one to slice open the tubing and 
expose the joint.  Use your razor blade to chop them off, or a pair of 
pliers to crush them down.</p>

<br>
<img src="SolderGuide_files/20Trim.jpg" align="right" height="310" width="600">

<br clear="all">

<br>

<h3>3.4.5 Test the core connection</h3>

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/21Strength.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="200">The core connection provides the structural integrity of the joint.  Test it to make sure it is strong.</p>

<p>The most important test is that the joint is stronger than the 
connection between the wire side and driver side connecters.  Set up the
 wire as shown below and join the white plastic connecters.  Grab the 
far ends of the wires and pull apart.</p>


<br clear="all">

<br>

<img src="SolderGuide_files/22Strength.jpg" align="right" height="332" width="600">

<br clear="all">

<br>

<p>The joint should hold and the plastic connecter should pop out.  This
 reflects good material design.  Should your soldered strand of wire 
come under stress (caught in a bicycle spoke or run over by an art car) 
the connecter will pop out for easy replacement, and the joint will 
hold.</p>     


<h3>3.4.6 Solder corona wires</h3>

<p>You will now connect the corona wires to the long pigtail of the 
connecter.  There are two methods for this step.  The first is slightly 
easier in that it requires less manual dexterity, but it also requires 
extra material (copper foil, provided in the Learn to Solder kit) and an
 extra sub-step or two.  The second method is faster and simpler, but 
requires more involved manipulation of fine wires.  Try them both (in 
different joints) and see which you prefer.</p>    

<h4>3.4.6.1 Method 1: Copper foil</h4>

<h5>3.4.6.1.1 Apply copper foil</h5>

<p>Cut a half-inch piece of copper foil and remove the adhesive backing.
  Wrap it around the base of the outer vinyl coating, just at the edge 
where it is stripped.  You should be able to bend the corona wires back 
over the outer coating and onto the copper foil.  You will now solder 
those wires onto the foil. </p>

<br clear="all">

<br>

<h5>3.4.6.1.2 Solder corona wires onto foil</h5>

<p>This one is easy because the bent corona wires stay in place and you 
have a free hand to apply the solder.  Hold the wire such that the tip 
of the soldering iron touches the copper foil just next to the bent 
corona wires.  The heat will quickly conduct throughout the foil and 
corona wires.  Apply solder to the corona wires where they touch the 
foil, and watch the Terminator-style liquid-metal flow over the joint.</p>

<br>

<h5>3.4.6.1.3 Solder long pigtail onto foil</h5>

<p>Now you’re going to solder the long pigtail of the connecter to the 
foil.  The connecter does not need to touch the soldered corona wires.  
Since the foil is conductive, any contact with the foil will create a 
connection between the corona wires and the connecter pigtail.  In fact,
 soldering the connecter to the foil on the side opposite the corona 
wires creates the most compact joint.</p>

<p>Apply a tiny bit of solder to the tip of the iron.  (A tiny bit.

That’s probably enough.)  Put the solder down.  You can probably hold 
the joint in one hand since the already soldered core wire provides some
 stability.  Bring the joint to the soldering iron.</p>  

<p>Fairly quickly, the available solder will flow over the foil and the 
factory pre-tinned connecter wires.  Once the solder flows, remove the 
joint from the heat of the iron so that it can cool.</p>  

<p>You have completed both of the soldered connections.  Here is what your completed joint looks like:</p>

<h4>3.4.6.2 Method 2: No foil</h4>
<p>Let's re-orient.  You've soldered the core wire to the shorter connecter pigtail <a href="#3.4.3">(3.4.3)</a> and are now ready to solder the corona wires onto the long connecter pigtail (without using foil).</p> 
<h5>3.4.6.2.1 Twist corona wires around connecter</h5>

<p>Bring the joint to the tip of the soldering iron.  Very quickly, the 
available solder will flow over the corona wires and the factory 
pre-tinned connecter wires.</p> 

<p>You have completed the second of the two soldered connections.  Trim off any spikes that protrude.</p>  

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/34Test.jpg" align="right" height="182" width="300">If you like, connect the wire-side and driver-side connecters, power the driver, and look at the pretty light.</p>

<br>

<h3>3.4.7 Apply heat-shrink tube</h3>

<p>Slide the heat-shrink tube you previously threaded in step <a href="#3.2.5">3.2.5</a> back over the connecter wire to cover the joint.  Now you must heat it.  There are two methods:</p>

<h4>3.4.7.1 Use some expensive method</h4>

<p>If you happen to have a heat gun or a paint stripper, now is the time
 to use it.  A hair drier will not be sufficient.  On the other hand, 
you can always . . .</p>

<h4>3.4.7.2 Use side of soldering iron</h4>
  
<p>Rub the tube-covered joint against the side of the soldering iron.  
Rotate to prevent burning.  Soon your tubing will be pleasingly shrunk.</p>

<p>Congratulations!  You have soldered your own piece of Cool Neon wire.</p>

<br><br>

<h1><a name="4">4. Other Joints</a></h1> 
<h2><a name="4.1">4.1 One driver; many wires</a></h2>
Up to now you have seen how to light a single strand of wire from a 
driver.  If you want to light more wires, do you need a driver for each?
  Not at all—you can light multiple wires from one driver. Here are two 
methods:  

<h3>4.1.1 Method 1: The Y connecter</h3>
<p>The Y-connecter provides a quick and painless way to run two strands of soldered wire off of one driver.</p>

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/36Y.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="300">The
 base of the Y-connector plugs into the driver side connector, and each 
branch accepts one strand of Cool Neon wire.  That’s it.  You’re good to
 glow (x2).</p>    

<p>Combine Y-connectors for more elaborate effects.  For example, plug a
 second and third Y-connector into the two branches of the first 
connector to end up with four strands of wire lit from the same driver.</p>  

<br clear="all">
<br>

<h3>4.1.2 Method 2: The Multi-Wire joint</h3>

<p>A different way to light multiple wires at once is to solder the 
separate wires together into the same connector.  Plug that 
mega-connector into a driver and they all light up.  Here’s how:</p>

<h4>4.1.2.1 Preparations</h4>

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/37ThreeWires.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="200">Here are three wires prepared to be soldered together into one connector.  Following section <a href="#3.2">3.2</a>
 above, each wire has had its outer coating stripped, its inner coating 
stripped, its corona wires tug-tested and bent back, and its core wire 
scraped free of phosphor.  The only difference in technique from the 
single-wire case is to expose a half-inch longer section of core wire.</p>

<p>Then, pre-tin each core wire separately (see <a href="#3.4.2">3.4.2</a>).</p>

<br clear="all">

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/38Twist.jpg" align="right" height="220" width="300">Twist the pre-tinned core wires together.</p>

<p>Similar to what we saw in section <a href="#3.1.2">3.1.2</a>, the

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/48Glue2.jpg" align="right" height="201" width="300">Lots of it.  This will give the shrink-wrap more to stick to.</p>

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/49Heat.jpg" align="right" height="178" width="300">Use a heat gun (or the side of soldering iron) to shrink it all down.</p>  

<br clear="all">

<p>Congratulations!  That’s a lot of color coming out of one driver.</p>  

<br>

<h3>4.1.3 Which method is best?</h3>
<p>Both Y-connected webs and multi-wired joints have associated plusses and minuses.</p>

<p>Advantages of the Y-connector:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Modularity</dt>
<dd>If one strand off a Y-connector fails to light, simply pull it out 
and plug in a new one.  Fix the old wire at your leisure.  By contrast, 
if one connection fails in a multi-wire joint, the whole thing goes 
dark.  You’ll need to open the joint, identify the problem, fix it, and 
reseal.  What a hassle.</dd>

<dt>Flexibility</dt>
<dd>Does the pink not contrast enough with the red?  Swap in a green 
instead.  Does one wire not extend far enough?  Pop it out, add an 
extension, and pop it back in.  Project over?  Tug the wires free for 
immediate re-use.  None of these steps are as easy in a multi-wire 
joint.</dd>
</dl>


<p>Advantages of the Multi-Wire joint:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Efficiency</dt>
<dd>After all the pre-tinning, a six-wire multi-joint requires just one 
soldered connection to the short pigtail, and another soldered 
connection to the long one.  That’s two connections rather than the 
twelve, for savings both of time and material.</dd>

<dt>Compactness</dt>
<dd>Each Y-connector adds a few inches to the total length of wire, and 
spreads out the origin point of each strand.  Of course, all excess wire
 can be rubber-banded together.  But certain projects, clothes 
especially, do better with a cleaner design.</dd> 
</dl>               

<p>The hypothetical project most deserving of a multi-wire joint might 
be an article of clothing, lit according to a complex and pre-tested 
design, that will be used and re-used multiple times.  By contrast, a 
prototype of an untested design that will be successively modified 
before being cannibalized, unmistakably calls out for a handful of 
Y-connectors.  Locate your own project along that continuum.</p>     

<br>
<h2><a name="4.2">4.2 Connecting wire to wire</a></h2>

<p>Both Y-connectors and Multi-wire joints produce parallel strands of 
wire emanating from the same point.  Suppose instead you want a single 
strand of wire to change color halfway down its length?  You need a 
wire-to-wire connection.</p>

<h3>4.2.1 Preparations</h3>

<p><img class="headright" src="SolderGuide_files/50Prep.jpg" align="right" height="206" width="300">Following section <a href="#3.2">3.2</a>,
 prepare the ends of two wires.  Each has its outer coating stripped,
